Week 5 Task board

This week we had to complete the javascript for a page to add a list of tasks to the page using jquery.

The page when loaded should show any tasks previously added to the page that havent been deleted.

When the add task button is clicked, a popup form appears with options for task title, a due date(with a calendar popup), and a description. Once these fields are entered there is a submit button. When this is clicked, the task is added to the page. 

Once a task is added to the page, it can be dragged and dropped to whatever section fits it best. Each card can also be deleted without deleted every task on the page.
